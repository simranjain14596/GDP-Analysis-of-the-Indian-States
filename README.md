# GDP-Analysis-of-the-Indian-States
There are two parts to this project. In the first part, you will analyse and compare the GDPs of various Indian states (both total and per capita). The GDP of a state is referred to as the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product). Then, you will divide the states into four categories based on the GDP per capita, and for each of these four categories, you will analyse the sectors that contribute the most to the GDP (such as agriculture, real estate, manufacturing, etc.).     In the second part, you will analyse whether GDP per capita is related to dropout rates in schools and colleges.
